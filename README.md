# grendelPhysicalOperationProgram

This repository stores the low level programs that create Grendels functionality. basically there is a chain of processing that takes raw data from cameras, microphones, sensors and the internet and processess that data to a point where the AI software can use it for something useful.  This is a massive work in progress, updates will come as I have time and as people show interest, so if you are interested star this repository.....

the basic architecture is simple, a processing program scans for messages that indicate there is new data and then sends commands to other computers in the system to process the data and return the processed data to the correct folder. currently i envision several layers of this happening, the last layer is AI ready data for the AI program to use in its decision making
